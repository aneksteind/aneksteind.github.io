Welcome! In case you were wondering what this site will be for, I'll fill you in; I have a few ideas in mind for this site, but they could certainly evolve over time. First, I wanted a place where I could write down the things I'm learning for a quick and easy way to refer to them in the future, as well as to reinforce the learning process itself. Secondly, I wanted a way to journal about things such as books and ideas that make me really think. Lastly, I want to give others the same sort of depth, originality, and meaning that I quickly come to love in other blogs I see around the web. On this blog you should expect to see everything from my journey into learning about quantum computing to something as simple as a book review. Either way, I hope you'll find it interesting.
